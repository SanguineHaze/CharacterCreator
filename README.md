##DnD 5e Character Creator by SanguineHaze

#Required items:
- Java must be installed (www.java.com) & up to date

#Planned Updates (As of Mar 10, 2017):
[Note: These are unordered. They will be completed in order of whatever I wish to tackle first]
- Improve Race generation (Allow selections of races //and or// race chance levels - common, rare, etc)
- Category based Stat Generation [Weak, Average, Base PC, Above Average, Epic] /u/eastwood6510
- Semi-Random Inventory Generation
- Semi-Random Loot Generation
- Handle Java Version issues [Will not work if java is out of date & fails silently]
- Webpage / Web Interface [Look into git.io pages] (In Progress: May 15, 2017)
- Actual Age Value (Either supplementing or replacing age category)
- Mobile App (Eventually)
- Ability Modifiers
- Display & SaveFile printouts should look as close to a stat page as possible
- Extra / Ability Descriptions (Or links / hover text / something)
- Change Name generation so it is related to the chosen race
	- Include name length changes to match PHB/DMG racial name average lengths
	- Include clan names
		-Clan names (BLOCKED - Required: Race related naming)
- Change Nickname generation so it is based off of chosen race and chosen profession (where applicable)
	- Change "Child" nicknames to be 100% child oriented
- Change Motivations so that Child has a special set of motivations (Current motivations don't make much sense for children)

#Recent Updates

###Dec 19th, 2016
- Refactor: Removed duplicate code which was being used in every class (sometimes multiple times) to build up the path to the sourceData folder & appropriate text file. This is now done in the ReadFromFile class. [25 chars now build in ~0.1 second]

###Dec 14, 2016
- Added Surnames
